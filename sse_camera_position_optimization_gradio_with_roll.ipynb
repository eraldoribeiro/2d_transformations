        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This program calculates the pose of the object with respect to the camera using PyTorch3D differentiable rendering. The method uses the difference between silhouettes as a cost function. It is a simple version of a render-and-compare approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "We assume that the SSE mesh file in `.ply` (or `.obj`) format are present in the directory `assets/`. This directory is created by the code and its files are downloaded from a Dropbox shared link.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of the demo is a `.gif` showing the (poses) iterations of the optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "This program was adapted from the example provided here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/docs/tutorials/camera_position_optimization_with_differentiable_rendering.ipynb\n",
        "\n",
        "In this program, we will learn the $[x, y, z]$ position of a camera given a reference image using differentiable rendering.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will first initialize a renderer with a starting position for the camera. We will then use this to generate an image, compute a loss with the reference image, and finally backpropagate through the entire pipeline to update the position of the camera.\n",
        "\n",
        "## PyTorch3D\n",
        "\n",
        "Modules `torch` and `torchvision` are required. If `pytorch3d` is not installed, install it using the following cell. Here, I modified to install PyTorch3D from my own pre-built wheel. Using my own pytorch3d wheel allows for faster installation. Installing from source takes a few minutes to complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pre-built PyTorch3D wheel is downloaded from my Dropbox (shared link). Another copy of the wheel is also stored in my Google Drive, and is located at: `/content/drive/MyDrive/research/projects/slosh_project/slosh_project_team_files/Colab_wheels/pytorch3d-0.7.8-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl`\n",

        "\n",
        "We will load a CAD model (i.e., `ply` format) file and create a **Meshes** object. **Meshes** is a unique datastructure provided in PyTorch3D for working with **batches of meshes of different sizes**. It has several useful class methods which are used in the rendering pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Create a renderer\n",
        "\n",
        "A **renderer** in PyTorch3D is composed of a **rasterizer** and a **shader** which each have a number of subcomponents such as a **camera** (orthographic/perspective). Here, we initialize some of these components and use default values for the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "For optimizing the camera position we will use a renderer which produces a **silhouette** of the object only and does not apply any **lighting** or **shading**. We will also initialize another renderer which applies full **Phong shading** and use this for visualizing the outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Create a reference image\n",
        "\n",
        "We will first position the teapot and generate an image. We use helper functions to rotate the teapot to a desired viewpoint. Then we can use the renderers to produce an image. Here we will use both renderers and visualize the silhouette and full shaded image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The world coordinate system is defined as +Y up, +X left and +Z in.\n",
        "\n",
        "We defined a camera which is positioned on the positive z axis hence sees the spout to the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Initialize the model and optimizer\n",
        "\n",
        "Create an instance of the **model** above and set up an **optimizer** for the camera position parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Run the optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "We run several iterations of the forward and backward pass and save outputs every 10 iterations. When this has finished take a look at `./optimization_sequence.gif` for a cool gif of the optimization process!\n",
